# Test Plan for QR Code Generator Application Modernisation Project - MVP Release 2024

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the MVP release 2024 of the QR Code Generator Application Modernisation Project. The goal of this plan is to ensure that the application meets the functional, non-functional, security, and usability requirements as outlined in the prioritised user stories.

## 2. Test Objectives

To validate the functional and non-functional requirements of the application, ensuring that the application is user-friendly, secure, and performs optimally under the expected load.

## 3. Test Scope

The scope of testing includes all the prioritised user stories for the MVP release 2024. This includes testing the QR code generation, customization, download, and sharing functionalities, as well as the application's performance, security, and usability. Specifically, the following functionalities will be tested:

- URL input for QR code generation
- QR code generation from the provided URL
- Embedding of website logo in the generated QR code
- Changing the background and color of the logo in the QR code
- Saving the generated QR code image to the user's machine
- Downloading the generated QR code image
- Sharing the generated QR code image with others

## 4. Test Schedule

The test schedule is as follows:

- Test Planning: January 1, 2024 - January 15, 2024
- Test Case Design: January 16, 2024 - February 15, 2024
- Test Environment Setup: February 16, 2024 - February 28, 2024
- Test Execution: March 1, 2024 - April 30, 2024
- Bug Fixing and Regression Testing: May 1, 2024 - May 31, 2024
- Final Regression and Closure: June 1, 2024 - June 15, 2024

## 5. Resource Planning

The following resources will be required for the testing process:

- Test Lead: 1
- Senior Test Engineers: 2
- Junior Test Engineers: 3
- Test Environment: A separate test environment that mirrors the production environment
- Test Tools: Selenium WebDriver for functional testing, JMeter for performance testing, OWASP ZAP for security testing, and JIRA for defect tracking

## 6. Test Environment

The test environment will be a mirror of the production environment. It will include:

- A Windows Server 2019 for hosting the application
- A SQL Server 2019 for the database
- A separate network segment to isolate the test environment from the production and development environments

## 7. Test Data

Test data will be created based on the requirements. This includes:

- A set of valid URLs for testing the QR code generation
- A set of invalid URLs for negative testing
- A set of images for testing the logo embedding and customization functionalities
- A set of different color codes for testing the logo color change functionality

## 8. Test Cases

Test cases will be designed based on the prioritised user stories. Each test case will cover a specific requirement and will include the test steps, expected results, and actual results.

## 9. Test Execution

Test cases will be executed based on the priority of the requirements. Regression testing will be performed after each defect fix.

## 10. Defect Management

Defects will be logged and tracked using a defect tracking tool like JIRA. The defect status will be regularly updated and communicated to the relevant stakeholders.

## 11. Test Deliverables

Test deliverables include test cases, test scripts, test data, test reports, and defect reports. These will be prepared and maintained throughout the testing process.

## 12. Risks and Mitigation

Potential risks include insufficient test coverage due to complex business logic, inadequate test data, delays in the delivery of development components, and unavailability of test environment. These risks will be mitigated through thorough test planning, regular communication with the development team, and early setup of the test environment.

## 13. Test Metrics

Test metrics like Test Coverage, Defect Density, Defect Leakage, etc., will be tracked and reported. These metrics will be used to assess the quality of the testing process and the application.

## 14. Test Status Reporting

Regular test status updates will be shared with all the stakeholders. This includes sharing the test progress, defect status, and test metrics.

## 15. Test Closure

Once all the test cases are executed and defects are closed, the test cycle will be closed. A test closure report will be prepared and shared with all the stakeholders.

## 16. Conclusion

This test plan aims to ensure that the MVP release 2024 of the QR Code Generator Application meets the required standards of functionality, performance, security, and usability. The success of this plan depends on the cooperation and collaboration of all the stakeholders involved in the project.
