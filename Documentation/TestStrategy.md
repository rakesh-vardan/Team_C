# Test Strategy for QR Code Generator Application Modernisation Project

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the QR Code Generator Application Modernisation Project. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that the application meets the functional, non-functional, security, and usability requirements as outlined in the user stories.

## 2. Test Levels

### 2.1 Unit Testing
Developers will perform unit testing on individual components using tools like NUnit or xUnit.

### 2.2 Integration Testing
Testers will perform integration testing to validate the interaction between different modules. This includes testing the integration between the UI and the backend services, and between the backend services and the database.

### 2.3 System Testing
Testers will perform system testing to validate the end-to-end functionality of the application. This includes testing all the user stories in a fully integrated environment.

### 2.4 User Acceptance Testing
The end users will perform UAT to validate the system from a user's perspective. This includes testing the usability and accessibility of the application on multiple devices.

## 3. Test Types

### 3.1 Functional Testing
Functional testing will be performed to validate the functional requirements. This includes testing all the user stories and validating the QR code generation, customization, and download functionalities.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Testing
Non-functional testing will be performed to validate the performance, security, and usability of the application. This includes testing the application's ability to handle multiple requests concurrently, its response time, and its availability.

### 3.3 Regression Testing
Regression testing will be performed to ensure that new changes have not affected the existing functionality. This includes re-testing the previously tested functionalities after each release.

## 4. Test Techniques

### 4.1 Manual Testing
Manual testing will be performed for exploratory testing and to validate the UI and UX. This includes testing the application's user-friendliness, intuitiveness, and error messages.

### 4.2 Automated Testing
Automated testing will be performed to automate repetitive tasks and regression testing. This includes automating the functional and non-functional tests using tools like Selenium WebDriver and JMeter.

## 5. Test Tools

### 5.1 Selenium WebDriver
Selenium WebDriver will be used for automating the functional tests. This includes automating the tests for the QR code generation, customization, and download functionalities.

### 5.2 JMeter
JMeter will be used for performance testing. This includes testing the application's ability to handle multiple requests concurrently and its response time.

### 5.3 OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP will be used for security testing. This includes testing the application's protection against common web attacks and its use of secure protocols for communication.

## 6. Test Environment

A test environment similar to the production environment will be set up for testing. This includes setting up the necessary servers, databases, and network configurations.

## 7. Test Data

Test data will be created based on the requirements. This includes creating URLs for testing the QR code generation, and images for testing the logo embedding and customization functionalities.

## 8. Risks

Potential risks include insufficient test coverage due to complex business logic, inadequate test data, delays in the delivery of development components, and unavailability of test environment. These risks will be mitigated through thorough test planning, regular communication with the development team, and early setup of the test environment.

## 9. Test Schedule

A detailed test schedule will be prepared based on the project timeline. This includes scheduling the test preparation, execution, and closure activities.

## 10. Resource Planning

The required resources (both human and technical) will be identified and allocated. This includes identifying the required test engineers, test tools, and test environments.

## 11. Test Deliverables

Test deliverables include test cases, test scripts, test data, test reports, and defect reports. These will be prepared and maintained throughout the testing process.

## 12. Test Execution Strategy

Test cases will be executed based on the priority of the requirements. Regression testing will be performed after each defect fix.

## 13. Defect Management

Defects will be logged and tracked using a defect tracking tool like JIRA. The defect status will be regularly updated and communicated to the relevant stakeholders.

## 14. Test Closure

Once all the test cases are executed and defects are closed, the test cycle will be closed. A test closure report will be prepared and shared with all the stakeholders.

## 15. Test Metrics

Test metrics like Test Coverage, Defect Density, Defect Leakage, etc., will be tracked and reported. These metrics will be used to assess the quality of the testing process and the application.

## 16. Test Status Reporting

Regular test status updates will be shared with all the stakeholders. This includes sharing the test progress, defect status, and test metrics.

## 17. Conclusion

This test strategy aims to ensure that the QR Code Generator Application meets the required standards of functionality, performance, security, and usability. The success of this strategy depends on the cooperation and collaboration of all the stakeholders involved in the project.
