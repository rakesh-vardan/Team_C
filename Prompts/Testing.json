This will help us understand if the application can handle such cases or if it has a maximum URL length limit.\n\n2. **Test Case for Special Characters in URL:** We should test how the application handles URLs with special characters. This will help us ensure that the application can handle all valid URLs.\n\n3. **Test Case for Simultaneous Requests:** We should test how the application behaves when multiple users are trying to generate QR codes at the same time. This will help us understand if the application can handle multiple requests concurrently.\n\n4. **Test Case for Offline Mode:** We should test how the application behaves when the user is offline or when there is a network issue. This will help us ensure that the application can handle such scenarios gracefully.\n\n5. **Test Case for QR Code Scanning:** We should test if the generated QR codes can be scanned correctly by various QR code scanning apps. This will help us ensure that the QR codes generated by the application are valid and usable.\n\n6. **Test Case for Saving QR Code in Different Formats:** We should test if the application allows the user to save the QR code in different image formats (like .jpg, .png, .bmp etc.). This will help us ensure that the application provides flexibility to the users in terms of the image format.\n\n7. **Test Case for Application Load:** We should test how the application behaves under heavy load. This will help us understand the application's performance under stress and identify any potential performance issues.\n\n8. **Test Case for Application Security:** We should test the application for common security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc. This will help us ensure that the application is secure.\n\n9. **Test Case for User Interface:** We should test the user interface of the application on various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) and browsers to ensure that it is responsive and user-friendly.",
